### 🌎 Hello there! 🌎

My name is Carlos Casciano, I'm a frontend developer focused on ReactJS.
Been working with tech for a while, learning about the best and worst from it. 
Wore many different 🎩 hats during my career! 

I'm currently available for remote positions as frontend developer.

My main tech skils floats around Javascript and React, but honestly, I can read the docs and tinker with most of technologies around if the correct amount of patience is provided.
