### 🌎 Hello there! 🌎

My name is Carlos Casciano, I'm a professional with years of experience on product, operations and software development.
Been working with tech for a while, learning about the best and worst from it. 
Wore many different 🎩 hats during my career! 


My main tech skils floats around Python, Javascript and React, but honestly, I can read docs and tinker with most of technologies around if the correct amount of patience is provided.
